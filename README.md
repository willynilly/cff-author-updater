# CFF Author Updater

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This GitHub Action adds contributors to the `authors:` section of your `CITATION.cff` file by analyzing pull requests and adding new contributors as authors. Contributors include: commit authors, commit co-authors, pull request reviewers, commenters on issues linked to the pull request, and comments on the pull request itself. You can customize which kinds of contributors can become authors. The action also enriches contributor metadata using GitHub and ORCID.

🛑 **Note:** This action does not modify your repository directly. It posts a comment on the pull request that include a block with your `CITATION.cff` file updated with new authors from that pull request. This comment also includes a detailed list of each new author's contributions (with links) that qualified them for authorship.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Updates `authors:` in `CITATION.cff` with contributors from PRs
- Customizable inclusive authorship. Allows a variety of contributors to become authors, including commit authors, commit co-authors, PR reviewers, linked issue authors, and linked issue commenters.
- Enriches metadata using GitHub profiles and ORCID lookups
- Skips duplicate authors using multiple identity checks
- Posts a pull request comment with the proposed CFF content, which can be manually copied to update the `CITATION.cff`. The comment also contains a detailed breakdown of each new author's qualifying contributions, grouped by category (commits, PR comments, reviews, issues, etc.), with clickable links to each contribution. It also contains warnings and logging information to help provide context for authorship detection and processing.
- Optionally invalidates pull request when a new author is missing from the `CITATION.cff`.
- Outputs updated `CITATION.cff` file and detailed constributions in a JSON file for other workflow steps to use.

To use this action in your repository:

- ✅ A `CITATION.cff` file must exist at the root of your repository, or you must specify a custom path using the `cff_path` input.
- ✅ Python is automatically set up by the action using `actions/setup-python`.
- ✅ You must pass GitHub’s built-in `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to the `github_token` input.
- ✅ You must reference this action in your workflow as:

  ```yaml
  uses: willynilly/action-update-cff-authors@v2.0.0
  ```

- ✅ For reproducibility, it is recommended to use version tags like `@v2.0.0`.

## 🧠 Contributor Classification and Identity Resolution

Contributors are grouped and processed according to their origin and identity metadata:

### 1. GitHub Users

When a contributor is associated with a GitHub account:

- **Individuals** (`type == "User"`):
  - Mapped to CFF `person`
  - Fields used: `given-names`, `family-names`, `alias`, `email`, `orcid`

- **Organizations** (`type == "Organization"`):
  - Mapped to CFF `entity`
  - Fields used: `name`, `alias`, `email` (if provided by GitHub)

> ORCID enrichment is only applied to individuals (`type: person`). The Github user profile URL is used for the `alias`

---

### 2. Non-GitHub Contributors

If a commit or co-author entry lacks a GitHub account (i.e. appears as a raw name/email):

- These are **initially treated as `entities`**.
- If both a name and email are present, and the contributor matches an existing `person`, they are promoted to `person`.
- If a name has only a single part (e.g. no `family-names`), the contributor is **retained as an `entity`**, and a warning is posted with the commit SHA.
- If only an email is provided (no name), the contributor is skipped with a warning.
- ORCID search is attempted to enrich metadata when a name is full enough (two parts).

#### Fields:
- `person`: `given-names`, `family-names`, `email`, `orcid`
- `entity`: `name`, `email` (if available), `alias` (optional)

> ⚠️ Contributors with missing `family-names` or emails are preserved as `entity` entries and clearly marked in warnings.

### 📋 Contributor Metadata Handling Table

**Definitions:**
- **Full name**: A name containing both given and family parts (e.g. `"Jane Doe"`)
- **Partial name**: A name with only one part (e.g. `"Jane"`)

| Contributor Type            | Example Name | Email Present | Name Present      | GitHub Username Present | Example Username | Action                                                     |
|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub User (individual)   | Jane Doe      | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Full            | ✅ Yes                   | `jdoe`           | Added as `person`                                          |
| GitHub User (organization) | CERN          | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes                   | `cern-official`  | Added as `entity`                                          |
| Non-GitHub (raw commit)    | Jane Doe      | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Full            | ❌ No                    | —                | Added as `person`                                          |
| Non-GitHub (raw commit)    | Jane          | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Partial         | ❌ No                    | —                | Added as `entity` with warning                             |
| Non-GitHub (raw commit)    | *N/A*         | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No              | ❌ No                    | —                | ❌ **Skipped**, warning: name required for CFF entity       |
| Non-GitHub (raw commit)    | Jane Doe      | ❌ No          | ✅ Full            | ❌ No                    | —                | Added as `entity` with warning if needed                   |
| Non-GitHub (raw commit)    | *N/A*         | ❌ No          | ❌ No              | ❌ No                    | —                | ❌ **Skipped**, warning: name and email both missing        |

> Warnings for skipped or downgraded contributors include the commit SHA for traceability.

### Deduplication Strategy

Before adding a contributor, the following identifiers are checked against existing CFF `authors:`:

1. ORCID
2. Email address
3. GitHub user profile URL as `alias` (if available)
4. Full name (`given-names` + `family-names`)
5. Entity name

A contributor is only added if **none of the above match**.

#### Author Type Enforcement

- Contributors **must have both a given name and family name** to be treated as a `person`.
- If only a single name part is available (e.g., "Plato"), the contributor is recorded as an `entity`.
- This prevents ambiguity and ensures consistent deduplication behavior.

### 🧩 Mapping Contributor Metadata to CFF Fields

This table describes how contributor metadata from GitHub or commits is mapped to fields in the `CITATION.cff` file:

| Source                         | Metadata Field         | CFF Field              | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub user (individual)      | GitHub username profile URL       | `alias`                | Added as `alias` for traceability                                     |
| GitHub user (individual)      | Profile name (e.g. "Jane Doe") | `given-names`, `family-names` | Split into first and last; if only one part, treated as `entity`     |
| GitHub user (individual)      | Email (if public)      | `email`                | Optional; used if present                                             |
| GitHub user (individual)      | ORCID in bio or matched | `orcid`                | Enriched via ORCID public API                                         |
| GitHub user (organization)    | GitHub username profile URL       | `alias`                | Added as `alias`                                                      |
| GitHub user (organization)    | Org display name       | `name`                 | Mapped to `entity` name                                               |
| GitHub user (organization)    | Email (if public)      | `email`                | Optional                                                              |
| Non-GitHub commit author      | Name (e.g. "Jane Doe") | `given-names`, `family-names` or `name` | If two parts → person; one part → `entity`                            |
| Non-GitHub commit author      | Email                  | `email`                | Used for deduplication and enrichment                                 |
| Non-GitHub commit author      | ORCID (matched)        | `orcid`                | If found and verified via ORCID API                                   |

> ✅ A contributor is classified as `type: person` only if both `given-names` and `family-names` are present. Otherwise, they are added as `type: entity`.

> ❌ If a contributor has no name and no GitHub username, they are skipped and a warning is posted (including the commit SHA for traceability).

## 🛠 Developer Notes

To run pytest tests, you must create a `.env` in the project folder
that contains `developer.env`. If you don't have a `.env`, you
can rename `developer.env` to `.env`.
