# CFF Author Updater

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This GitHub Action adds contributors to the `authors:` section of your `CITATION.cff` file by analyzing pull requests and adding new contributors as authors. Contributors include: commit authors, commit co-authors, pull request reviewers, commenters on issues linked to the pull request, and comments on the pull request itself. You can customize which kinds of contributors can become authors. The action also enriches contributor metadata using GitHub and ORCID.

üõë **Note:** This action does not modify your repository directly. It posts a comment on the pull request that includes a block with your `CITATION.cff` file updated with new authors from that pull request. This comment also includes a detailed list of each new author's contributions (with links) that qualified them for authorship.

---

## üîß Features

- Updates `authors` in CFF files (e.g. `CITATION.cff`) with contributors from PRs. Currently uses CFF version 1.2.0.
- Customizable inclusive authorship. Allows a variety of contributors to become authors, including commit authors, commit co-authors, PR reviewers, linked issue authors, and linked issue commenters.
- Enriches metadata using GitHub profiles and ORCID lookups
- Skips duplicate authors using multiple identity checks, with optional manual contributor overrides via PR comments (skip/unskip commands)
- Posts a pull request comment with the proposed CFF content, which can be manually copied to update the `CITATION.cff`. The comment also contains a detailed breakdown of each new author's qualifying contributions, grouped by category (commits, PR comments, reviews, issues, etc.), with clickable links to each contribution. It also contains warnings and logging information to help provide context for authorship detection and processing.
- Options for invalidating pull request when a new author is missing from the `CITATION.cff`, when there are duplicate authors, or when `cffconvert` fails to validate `CITATION.cff`.
- Outputs updated `CITATION.cff` file, detailed contributions in a JSON file, validation metadata, and logs for other workflow steps to use.

| `bot_blacklist`              | Comma-separated GitHub usernames to exclude from authorship      | ‚ùå No    | `github-actions[bot]`  |

**Note:** When `invalid_cff_invalidates_pr` is enabled, the pull request will be invalidated (workflow will fail) if `cffconvert` reports any validation errors on the CFF file.  
Typical reasons for `cffconvert` validation failure include:
- Duplicate authors (e.g. same ORCID, same author block)
- Invalid or missing required fields (violating Citation File Format spec)
- Incorrect field formats (e.g. malformed ORCID URL)

Any `cffconvert` errors will also appear in the pull request comment under the **Warnings** section.

The `invalid_cff_invalidates_pr` flag enforces the official CFF format standard (as validated by `cffconvert`).  
The `missing_author_invalidates_pr` and `duplicate_author_invalidates_pr` flags provide **additional semantic validation** beyond the CFF format. They use the **Deduplication Strategy** described below.

## üß† Contributor Classification and Identity Resolution

Contributors are grouped and processed according to their origin and identity metadata:

### 1. GitHub Users

When a contributor is associated with a GitHub account:

- **Individuals** (`type == "User"`):
  - Mapped to CFF `person` if `given-names` and `family-names` is available.
  - Otherwise, mapped to CFF `entity` using CFF `name`.
  - CFF Fields used: `given-names` (from GitHub or ORCID profiles if available), `family-names` (from GitHub or ORCID profiles if available), `alias` (is GitHub user profile URL), `email` (from GitHub profile if available), `orcid` (from GitHub profile or ORCID email search if available)

- **Organizations** (`type == "Organization"`):
  - Mapped to CFF `entity`
  - CFF Fields used: `name` (from GitHub or ORCID profiles if available), `alias` (is GitHub user profile URL), `email` (from GitHub profile if available)


> GitHub enrichment currently only consists of adding the following metadata from the GitHub user profile: name, email, bio, and blog (i.e., website). The bio and blog are not currently mapped to CFF fields. However, they are used to extract missing ORCID information.  

> ORCID enrichment currently only consists of adding an ORCID and, if available, a name, to a CFF author if it cannot find one from the GitHub profile metadata. It is only applied to individuals GitHub contributors (`type: person`) that are new authors. Moreover, it requires one of several mechanisms to acquire the ORCID, and subsequently the author name associated with that ORCID:

1. The GitHub account has been linked to their ORCID account. The GitHub action scrapes the ORCID from a badge on their user profile page.
2. GitHub user profile has an ORCID listed as their website/blog, or they list it in their bio. The GitHub action uses the GitHub API to extract it from this user profile data.
3. GitHub user has shared their public email and then this email is used to search for a corresponding ORCID account using the ORCID API. Most ORCID users do not make their email addresses public, so this method rarely is used. 

---

### 2. Non-GitHub Contributors

If a commit or co-author entry lacks a GitHub account (i.e. appears as a raw name/email):

- These are **initially treated as `entities`**.
- However, if the contributor matches an existing `person` in the CFF through the **deduplication strategy**, they are identified as that person.
- If a name has only a single part (e.g. no `family-names`), the contributor is **retained as an `entity`**.
- If only an email is provided (i.e., no name), and a name cannot be found on an ORCID profile associated with that email, then the contributor is skipped.
- ORCID enrichment currently only consists of adding an ORCID and a missing author name. It is only applied to git commiters that have an email address, and whose ORCID profile has made that email address public. Most ORCID accounts do not make their email addresses public on their profiles, so this enrichment rarely occurs.

#### CFF Fields:
- `person`: `given-names` (from git commit name or ORCID profile if available), `family-names` (from git commit name or ORCID profile is available), `email` (from git commit email if available), `orcid` (from git commit email and ORCID email search if available)
- `entity`: `name`, `email` (from git commit email if available)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Contributors with missing `given-names`, `family-names` or `email` are preserved as `entity` entries.

### üìã Contributor Metadata Handling Table

**Definitions:**
- **Full name**: A name containing both given and family parts (e.g. `"Jane Doe"`)
- **Partial name**: A name with only one part (e.g. `"Jane"`)

| Contributor Type            | Example Name | Email Present | Name Present      | GitHub Username Present | Example Username | Action                                                     |

> Warnings for skipped or downgraded contributors include the commit SHA for traceability.

---

### Deduplication Strategy

Before adding a contributor, the following identifiers are checked against existing CFF `authors:` **in this order**:

1. **ORCID:** If both authors have an ORCID and they match, they are considered the same.
2. **Email:** If both authors have an email and they match, they are considered the same.
3. **GitHub user profile URL as `alias`:** If both authors have an `alias` that is a GitHub user profile URL and they match, they are considered the same.
4. **Full name:** If both authors have a full name (for persons: `given-names` + `family-names`; for entities: `name`) and they match (case-insensitive, whitespace-insensitive), they are considered the same author.


### üîç Deduplication Algorithm Summary

| Priority | Matching Field | Behavior |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | ORCID | If both have ORCID and it matches ‚Üí same author |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | GitHub `alias` (GitHub profile URL) | If both have alias and it matches ‚Üí same author |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | Email | If both have email and it matches ‚Üí same author |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | Full Name (given-names + family-names, or entity `name`) | If full names match ‚Üí same author |

## ‚úã Manual Overrides: Skip / Unskip Contributors for Authorship

In some cases, the GitHub Action may detect a contributor identity that is incorrect, duplicated, or that the maintainers do not wish to include as an author in the `CITATION.cff` file.

To handle these cases, **maintainers can post PR comments with `skip-authorship` or `unskip-authorship` commands** to manually override contributor processing for that pull request.

### Supported Commands

You can skip or unskip contributors for authorship by writing a comment with one of these commands:

| Command                              | Example |
|--------------------------------------|---------|
| `skip-authorship-by-github-username`      | `skip-authorship-by-github-username someuser` |
| `unskip-authorship-by-github-username`    | `unskip-authorship-by-github-username someuser` |
| `skip-authorship-by-email`                | `skip-authorship-by-email user@example.com` |
| `unskip-authorship-by-email`              | `unskip-authorship-by-email user@example.com` |
| `skip-authorship-by-name`                 | `skip-authorship-by-name John Doe` |
| `unskip-authorship-by-name`               | `unskip-authorship-by-name John Doe` |
| `skip-authorship-by-orcid`                | `skip-authorship-by-orcid https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000` |
| `unskip-authorship-by-orcid`              | `unskip-authorship-by-orcid https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000` |


### How manual overrides work

- The Action scans **all PR comments**, ordered chronologically.
- The most recent command for each contributor field wins.
- If a contributor is currently skipped for authorship, the Action will:
  - **Exclude them** from recommended CFF updates
  - **Exclude them** from "missing author" checks

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Skipping a contributor does NOT remove them from the CFF file if they were already present, and does NOT prevent a user from manually adding them to the CFF file in this pull request.
  Skipped contributors are still included in duplicate author checks if present in the CFF file.
  The skip command only prevents the Action from recommending or requiring their addition as a new author.

- You can **change your mind** at any time by posting an `unskip-authorship` command.
- Deleting a comment with a skip command works as if you never wrote that comment.
- Deleting a comment with an unskip command works as if you never wrote that comment. 
- You will need to manually restart the workflow or post another commit to the pull request for newly posted commands to take effect. Posting a pull request comment does not currently trigger the GitHub Action.
- These commands only apply to new contributors on head branch (e.g., the forked branch you are trying to merge) of the pull request. They do not apply to old authors on the base branch (i.e. the branch into which the pull request merges).

### Example of changing your mind with commands. 

Here a contributor is skipped by email and then unskipped by email.

```markdown
skip-authorship-by-email user@example.com
```

```markdown
unskip-authorship-by-email user@example.com
```

Note: You do not need to delete old comments ‚Äî the Action will always apply the most recent command for each contributor field.


## üõ† Developer Notes

To run pytest tests, you must create a `.env` in the project folder
that contains `developer.env`. If you don't have a `.env`, you
can rename `developer.env` to `.env`.
